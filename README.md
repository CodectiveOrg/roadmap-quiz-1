## Tasks

Consider that we're developing a web app for a library.
The client wants following features:

- [ ] View all books.
- [ ] Add a new book.
- [ ] Edit an existing book.
- [ ] Remove an existing book.

Since currently you don't have the knowledge to develop a JavaScript project for the web,
all the work regarding that matter has already done,
and you don't need to know worry about it.  
The only thing you need to do is to write the proper logic according to client's requested features.

### Setup

- [ ] Initialize the project with `npm`.
- [ ] Install Prettier.
- [ ] Create a CSS file and write necessary styles in it.
- [ ] Create a JavaScript file and write necessary logic in it.
- [ ] Implement the design based on `design.png`.

### HTML

- [ ] Add `DOCTYPE`.
- [ ] Add proper tags to the `head`.
- [ ] Use `table` to show the list of books.
- [ ] Use `form` to add and edit books.
- [ ] Use `button` with `bin.png` to remove books.

## Notes

**Ignore these files and folders**:

- .gitignore
